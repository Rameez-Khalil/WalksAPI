/*
 * DTOs - Data Transfer Objects: 
 *      1. They are used to transfer the data between different layers.
 *      2. They typically contain a subset of properties in the domain model.
 *      3. Instead of expsing the domain model we send back the DTOs.
 *      
 *      
 *      This allows:
 *          1. Separation of concerns.
 *          2. Performance.
 *          3. Security.
 *          4. Versioning.
 *
